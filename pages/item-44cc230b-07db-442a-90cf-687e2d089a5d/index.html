<p>Elements can integrate deeply into HAX state management using what we call "hax hooks". By supplying a method on your web component like <b>static get haxHooks()</b>
Â you are magically able to tap into different life-cycle steps within the HAX editor.</p>
<p>Because of the simplicity and power of haxHooks this may not be an exhaustive list and <a href="https://github.com/elmsln/lrnwebcomponents/blob/master/elements/hax-body-behaviors/lib/HAXWiring.js#L154-L181" target="_blank">the internal code documentation on this should be consulted</a>
 (or open an issue to ensure we document a missing hook!)</p>
