<p>Elements can integrate deeply into HAX state management using what we call "hax hooks". By supplying a method on your web component like <b>haxHooks()</b>
 you are magically able to tap into different life-cycle steps within the HAX editor.
</p>
<p>Because of the simplicity and power of <b>haxHooks</b>
 this may not be an exhaustive list and 
  <a href="https://github.com/elmsln/lrnwebcomponents/blob/master/elements/hax-body-behaviors/lib/HAXWiring.js#L154-L181" target="_blank">the internal code documentation on this should be consulted</a>
 (or open an issue to ensure we document a missing hook!)

<h3 id="header-a76abd90-f808-1082-c4d7-a1a8161f1202"><span>gizmoRegistration(store)</span></h3>
<p>The most powerful hook in haxHooks. This fires whenever an element is read in via the appStore and it's definition loaded for use. This hook supplies an instance of the HAXStore which is the internal state management of HAX (written in MobX). You can use this object to do whatever you want to HAX. While seemingly too powerful, here are some examples of past things to leverage this super power for good</p>
<ul><li><a href="https://github.com/elmsln/lrnwebcomponents/blob/master/elements/code-sample/src/code-sample.js#L44-L79">code-sample</a>
 - the code-sample tag uses this hook in order to inject additional shortcut logic. If the tag is supplied, things like <b>```js</b>
 will convert to a JS based code-sample. It also hijacks the baked in support for <b>```</b>
 in order to inject a code-sample tag instead of the default <b>code</b>
 tag</li>
<li>supplying "apps" based on tag - <a href="https://github.com/elmsln/lrnwebcomponents/blob/master/elements/wikipedia-query/src/wikipedia-query.js#L183-L206">wikipedia-query</a>
 and <a href="https://github.com/elmsln/lrnwebcomponents/blob/master/elements/github-preview/src/github-preview.js#L585-L605">github-preview</a>
 supply custom public API search endpoints based on their tag being loaded. This way you can use the "Media" menu in order to search Github or Wikipedia in HAX just by including these tags in your autoloader block of the appstore.</li>
<li>supplying translatable haxProperties - <a href="https://github.com/elmsln/lrnwebcomponents/blob/master/elements/meme-maker/src/meme-maker.js#L150-L163">meme-maker</a>
 and <a href="https://github.com/elmsln/lrnwebcomponents/blob/master/elements/twitter-embed/src/twitter-embed.js#L87-L100">twitter-embed</a>
 supply custom translations for their haxProperties. This means that if you were to edit these elements using the editor in Spanish (es), you would see the fields and example inputs in Spanish (es) as opposed to their English (en) default text supplied by the <b>static get haxProperties()</b>
 method.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="header-61fcd58b-8c7c-e4f1-3925-08b6a6df81fe"><span>activeElementChanged(element, value)</span></h3>
<p>This runs whenever a user activates / selects an element to modify in HAX. This supplies an instance of the element / DOM node that is active as well as if we are active (true) or inactive (false). This hook can be used to modify state / functional aspects of your elements just prior to it receiving activation by hax. An example use-case for this could be preventing default behavior for an element that is a clickable link (see: <a href="https://github.com/elmsln/lrnwebcomponents/blob/master/elements/course-design/lib/ebook-button.js#L127-L163">ebook-button</a>
). Another possible usage is making pieces of the internal <b>shadowRoot</b>
 <i>contenteditable</i>
, only while activated (see: <a href="https://github.com/elmsln/lrnwebcomponents/blob/master/elements/meme-maker/src/meme-maker.js#L164-L183">meme-maker</a>
).</p>
<h3 id="header-2d80fd1f-94a4-f919-6b9d-e38d793caa88"><span>editModeChanged(value)</span></h3>
<p>This runs on all active nodes in the <b>hax-body</b>
 tag when the editing state of the HAX editor itself changes. If we are now editing, value is <b>true</b>
, when we go to save / are no longer editing, it is <b>false</b>
.</p>
