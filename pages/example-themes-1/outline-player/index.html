<p>Outline player is an even more basic form of Learn two. It's for those seeking something even more minimalist in design and capabilities.</p>
<p>Fun things about this include... ok well very little. Let's face it, this was the first theme we made and then we decided to keep supporting it because it helps illustrate the modular nature of our UI layer.</p>
<p>As examples</p>
<p style="width: 100%;">The `< site - menu >` on the left side is the exact same tag that's found in the <a href="learn-two">Learn Two theme</a>
. The buttons at the top are the same as in other themes (most of the initial ones). This abstraction of state from design allows you to focus on CSS and leave the front end engineering to... well.. no one, it just sorta happens.</p>
