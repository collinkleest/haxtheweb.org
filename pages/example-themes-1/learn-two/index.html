<p>Learn two is a straight forward way of presenting material for learning about a topic. With a breadcrumb trail `<site - breadcrumb>` and a simple `<site - menu>` that tracks visually as you activate new items, it's a great way to present educational material.</p>
<p>Learn two also has great mobile support (try it out but changing the dimensions of your browser)</p>
