<p>As you can see, the minimalist theme is for trying to give you a straight forward, linear design pattern.</p>
<p>Pages are ordered based on the very 1 page's child pages.</p>
<p>So you'd have a structure like this:</p>
<ul><li>Home</li>
<ul><li>Page 1</li>
<li>Page 2</li>
<li>Page 3</li>
</ul>

<li>This page wouldn't show up in the nav</li>
</ul>
