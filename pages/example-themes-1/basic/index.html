<p>The Basic theme provides a simple yet highly themable structure. It's leveraging the bulk of our custom elements specifically geared toward HAXcms state encapsulation</p>

<p>The theme elements in HAXcms can completely encapsulate state. So the menu on the left of this design (as one example) is called<b> `< site - children - block ><site -="" children="" block="">`</site>
</b>

. Site children block will automatically show what's below the current page / inside the ancestor tree as the current hierarchy.</p>
<p>That means if you used it in your theme, you could easily just style it and never have to think about state management / what's active. This approach is in all our themes at some level, the most pervasive of which is the next and previous buttons which are <b>`< site - menu - button type="next >`</b>

 in their format.</p>
