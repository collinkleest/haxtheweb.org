<p><b>Add</b>
 is how you add new assets to HAX from remote places. If you paste a URL, you can hit <b><i>configure item</i>
</b>
 and have it added. HAX will see if it has any way of guessing what the link is (for example a csv or mp4 will trigger hits against <i>document</i>
 or <i>video </i>
types).</p>
