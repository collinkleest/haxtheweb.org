<p>The HAX UI can be broken down into three major production concepts. Content authors are either:</p>
<ol><li>Adding something they already have</li>
<li>Finding something to add to their content<br/></li>
<li>Making something to go in their content</li>
</ol>
<p>This could be media, text, or content found elsewhere. These three main concepts of content production can be seen as the primary methods of production in the UI at the top bar.</p>
